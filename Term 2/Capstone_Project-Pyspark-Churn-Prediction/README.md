About
Udacity Capstone Project - Analyzing and predicting churn for a music app Sparkify in Pyspark. The dataset is a log of events which provides information about the user, event and environment. Here, churn is determined as the cancellation of the users account.

Files Description
1. mini_sparkify_event_data.json - Stores the event data in json format.
2. SparkifyProject.ipynb - The project code is all here.
3. workspace_utils.py - Used to stop Udacity environment from suspending. Code will work the same without with_active_session(): calls which were used before training.
