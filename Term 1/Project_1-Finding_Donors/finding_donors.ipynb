    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model 1 - Logistic Regression**\n",
    "1. Real Life Applications:\n",
    "    - Logistic regression is generally in predictive analytics for prediction of output which is binary. It has many uses in the medical field, for example, the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), which is widely used to predict mortality in injured patients. [1]\n",
    "2. Strength \n",
    "    - Resuls are interpretable. [2]  \n",
    "    - Gives relative importance of each predictor [2]\n",
    "3. Weakness\n",
    "    - If there are too many cells with no reponses, then the model will not fit the data [2]\n",
    "    - Does not handle outliers well [2]\n",
    "4. This model is a good candidate for the problem because:\n",
    "    - Logistic Regression is a powerful way of modelling a binomial outcome where the predictor variables (continuous or categorical) exhibit less correlation. In this case, we have to predict a binary label (income >=50K or <50K) and using scatter plots, the features seem to exhibit very less correlation. [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Model 2 - Ensemble Methods - AdaBoost Classifier**\n",
    "1. Real Life Applications:\n",
    "    - AdaBoost algorithms is used in the problem of Face Detection in video and images. [3]\n",
    "2. Strengths:\n",
    "    - Not very susceptible to overfitting.[3]\n",
    "    - Flexible with respect to distributions and baseleaner selections. Can combine with any (or many) classifiers to find weak hypothesis like neural networks, decisions trees, simple rules of thumb etc. [4]\n",
    "3. Weaknesses:\n",
    "    - Not good for noisy data [3]\n",
    "    - If hypothesis is too complex, test error may be larger than training error [4]\n",
    "4. This model is a good candidate for the problem because:\n",
    "    - Adaboost performs well but noisy data and outliers impact its performance negatively. However, this data set does not have many outliers so we can use this model. [4] \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model 3 - Ensemble Methods - Random Forest**\n",
    "1. Real Life :\n",
    "    - This model can be used in object detection in images - in large-scale real-world scenes situations, such as in gaming. It handles large training datasets and many class for object detection efficiently. [6] \n",
    "2. Strengths:\n",
    "    - Performs well for small and large datasets [6]\n",
    "    - Balances variance and bias well.  [5]\n",
    "    - Individual decision trees can be trained in parallel. [6]\n",
    "3. Weaknesses:\n",
    "    - They’re not easily interpretable [5]\n",
    "4. This model is a good candidate for the problem because:\n",
    "    - It is able to deal with unbalanced data (we have 3:1 ratio for positive to negative classifications) [6]\n",
    "    - It works well with a mixture of numerical and categorical features. [6]\n",

    "Adaboost (short for Adaptive boosting) is a boosting algorithm in machine learning used for classification and regression. Boosting converts a set of weak learners to a strong learner. Weak learners output a hypothesis that performs only slightly better than a coin toss whereas, strong learners output highly accurate predictions. In the Adaboost algorithm, weak learners are tuned by combining their weighted sum to give the strong learner. \n",
    "\n",
    "This combination is generated by giving different weights to the training data. The algorithm starts with the labels being predicted, giving equal weight to each observation. If a learner predicts a point incorrectly, it is given higher weight in the subsequent predictions. Learners are continuously added until we reach a given accuracy or imposed constraint on the number of models. Adaboost is adaptive and we can use a variety of machine learning algorithms as the base (weak) learner provided, it accepts weight on a training data set. Another advantage is the training process of this algorithm only selects those features that improve the predicting power. This in turn reduces the dimensionality as well as predicting time. \n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn.
